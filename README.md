Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors from the Foundations Course of the Odin Project

For this project, I am tasked to create a rock, paper, scissors game that is playable within the console. The game is five rounds, with the program keeping track of the score, announcing the who won each round and the overall winner of the game.
